# simple_animations

A Flutter project demonstrating basic animations using `AnimatedContainer` and `AnimatedOpacity`.

## Features

This application showcases:
- **AnimatedContainer**: Changes in size, color, and alignment with a smooth transition.
- **AnimatedOpacity**: Fades an element in and out.

Both animations are triggered by a floating action button.
